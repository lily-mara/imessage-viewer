# iMessage Viewer

⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - USE A COPY OF YOUR MESSAGE DATABASE ⚠️

UI for browsing your iMessage history based on the
`~/Library/Messages/chats.db` file. This project exists because the official
iMessage application is embarassingly bad at reading any messages other than the
most recent.

## goals
